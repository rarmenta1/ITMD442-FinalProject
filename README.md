----

**Project Description** - 

**Development Environment** - For this project I used my Windows 10 desktop, with Node JS version v18.13.0, I used Visual Studio Code to write my code, and I used GitHub Desktop to push my files here.

**Installation/Running Instructions:** â€“ In order to run the app, you are going to have to make sure NodeJS is installed. Once it is installed, you would then need to clone this repository and place it wherever you want. Next, you are going to need to open your command line and go to the directory of the cloned repository. Once there you are going to need to type *npm i* to install the dependencies. Next, you need to type: npm start. Finally, you just travel to localhost:3000 on any web browser.
