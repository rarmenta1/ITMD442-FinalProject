**Project Description** - Hello and Welcome to my Final Project. For my final project I decided to make some kind of figure collection tracker of some sorts as I thought it would be kind of fun to make. Additionally, I feel like I may be able to use this even after the semester ends as I feel like I could use this to track my future figure purchases. Of course, I will be updating this website as time goes on as a side project of mine. So far this website is able to record various information about some figures like the figure name, the series they're from, they're scales, when they come out, the manufacturer, and I even left some space for a URL so I can view it from the place I bought it from. In the future I hope to add more features such as being able to sort and filter figures, have a better database setup, fix the autentication problem I had, and simply make the website look and feel nicer. Anyways, here is my project and below here is the log-in/sign-up link.

**Development Environment** - For this project I used my Windows 10 desktop, with Node JS version v18.13.0, I used Visual Studio Code to write my code, and I used GitHub Desktop to push my files here.

**Installation/Running Instructions:** â€“ In order to run the app, you are going to have to make sure NodeJS is installed. Once it is installed, you would then need to clone this repository and place it wherever you want. Next, you are going to need to open your command line and go to the directory of the cloned repository. Once there you are going to need to type *npm i* to install the dependencies. Next, you need to type: npm start. Finally, you just travel to localhost:3000 on any web browser.

**Insights and Results** - I was able to get most of the things working but I failed to properly get the authentication to work. Moving forward this is a project I would love to continue working on the side. Making the UI look much better and fixing the authentication problem are things that I would hopefully have resolved after the semester ends. Overall, I feel like I could have done much better but it is what it is.
